# Another toy kernel i guess 

A microkernel for made for fun.

## Dependencys
* QEMU riscv64
* gcc riscv64 cross tool chain

TBD but your going to need a cross compiler for risc-v

`make` and then `make qemu` to test it. 
`make qemu-debug` and `make gdb` may be helpfull for debuging.
## Usage 

TBD
